Donate+Assist

Overview

People deposit ETH into a contract which releases funds to local authorities and/or NGOs if prescribed weather conditions are met. This allows targeted and transparent assistance to regions affected by adverse weather events such as flooding and drought. This initial implementation focuses on flooding.

The project uses the AccuWeather Chainlink Node to provide accurate weather data.
