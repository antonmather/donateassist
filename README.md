Donate+Assist

Overview

People deposit ETH into a contract which releases funds to local authorities if prescribed 24 hour rainfall parameters are met. This allows rapid, targeted and transparent assistance to cities affected by flooding.

There are two deposit mechanisms. Firstly, cities add funds to the contract as a form of pooled insurance. If the threshold/s are met then funds are withdrawn proportionally to the cities affected. Secondly, there is also a "Pot" that private citizens, NGOs and other parties can contribute to. If the threshold is met then this is distributed with the same ratio.

In practice, it is likely that only one city would meet the threshold at any one time due to the low likelihood of flooding occurring in two cities in the same period.

We used the New Zealand cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch in this demo.

The project uses the AccuWeather Chainlink Node to provide accurate weather data.
