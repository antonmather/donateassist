Donate+Assist

Overview

Donators deposit ETH into a contract which releases funds to local charities if prescribed weather conditions are met. This allows targeted and transparent assistance to regions affected by adverse weather events such as flooding and drought.

The dApp uses the Google Weather Oracle API (using a Chainlink adaptor) to provide accurate weather data.
