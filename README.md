Donate+Assist

Overview

People deposit ETH into a contract which releases funds to local authorities if prescribed weather conditions are met. This allows targeted and transparent assistance to cities affected by flooding.

The cities add funds to protect themselves in event of flooding. If the threshold is met then funds are withdrawn proportionally. There is also a "Pot" that private citizens, NGOs and other parties can contribute to. If the threshold is met then this is distributed with the same ratio.

The project uses the AccuWeather Chainlink Node to provide accurate weather data.
